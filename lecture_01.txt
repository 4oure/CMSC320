What is data science?
    The application of computational and statistical techniques to address or gain
    managerial or scientific insight into some problem in the real world.

    Using data to solve problems
        Decision making
        Product recommendation
        Predicting outcome

AI: any technique that enables computers ot mimic human intelligence (decision trees, rules, logic, ML)

ML: a subset of AI that uses statisitcal techniques that enable machines to use experience to improve at tasks

Deep Learning: a subset of ML that uses vast amounts of data and multilayer neural nets to enable
a machine to train tiself to perform tasks

Big data describes datasets with large volume, created and updated with high velocity, that have variety in 
structure and foramt. As more companie sand organizations collect and use big data, the demand for people with 
data science skills grows.
    Often collected from various sources, often from 3 v's: 
        volume: vast amount of data generated or collected. volume of global data has increased exponentially
        velocity: represents the speed at which data is generated, procesed, and analyzed, often in real-time or near real-time
        variety: lots of different forms, like spreadsheets, tables, images, videos, sound, text, etc.
